  Question:
  You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
  You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
  Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
  -----------------------------------------------------------
  Solution:
  int maxProfit(vector<int> &prices) {
      int maxPro = 0;
      int minPrice = INT_MAX;
      for(int i = 0; i < prices.size(); i++){
          minPrice = min(minPrice, prices[i]);
          maxPro = max(maxPro, prices[i] - minPrice);
      }
      return maxPro;
  }
